# Data Projects

This repository contains a collection of various personal data science projects that I have worked on. These
include

* [Uber Pickup Data For New York City](uber_data/)
    * Exploration and analysis of Uber pickup locations and times in New York City based on [data from
      FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response). 

* [MNIST Digit Recognition](mnist/)
    * Novel methods involving MNIST digit recognition. Includes restricting convolutional filters
      to a low-dimensional sub-space consiting of harmonic polynomials.
